I'm Maximiliano, or just **Max**.

I dwell in Brooklyn, NY with a girl and a dog.

I love working with software. The idea that computers can just talk to each other from different parts of the world amazes me. I'm fortunate enough to get paid to program these little guys.

I'm a college graduate with a BS in Computer Science. I've taught high schoolers Computer Science. I've taught college students Computer Science (I hope). I've taught myself Computer Science.

I love chatting with aspiring and current programmers. You might even find my name on some coffee chat lists floating around github.

I used to be a short story writer. The challenge of putting a moment into just a few words is wow.

I'm currently working on **[Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/products/classroom/)**, where I build a little bit of everything. On Mondays, you can find me complaining about [Originality Reports](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9335819?hl=en) (my youngest child) to the team.

_(Note to Max - fill this out as I do more cool stuff)_
