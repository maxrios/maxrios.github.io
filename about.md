I'm Maximiliano, or just **Max**. I love to program. It's an addiction that I haven't been able to break yet. It's just too fun building things that help people.

When I'm not programming, I'm typically listening to music (hip-hop, jazz, and R&B), playing games (usually Baldurs Gate 3 or Pokemon), or collecting tech. I think preservation and sharing is really cool, so I've been building out my digital and physical music collection (MP3s and CDs). I also play with my dog Maisie a lot!

I'm currently working on **[Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/products/classroom/)**, where I build a little bit of everything. On Mondays, you can find me complaining about [Originality Reports](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9335819?hl=en) (my youngest child) to the team.
