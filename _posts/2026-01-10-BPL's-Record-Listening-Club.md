I recently attended the Brooklyn Public Library's Record Listening Club, at the Adams Street location. It's a wonderful way to expose yourself to musicians you've never heard of. I brought *Kollage* by Bahamadia and played songs like *Spontaneity*, *Rugged Ruff*, and *3 the Hard Way*. During the listening session, I was introduced to *Water from an Ancient Well* by Abdullah Ibrahim. His South African jazz was calming and fresh. 

This new club is welcoming and diverse!
