<p><br />
A blog / log / notebook / brain dump on tech, video games, books, music, or whatever. Expect a mixed bag of posts that will likely never have a schedule. Some might even just be pictures. The goal is to consolidate my thoughts recorded in far too many notebooks (they’re just so fun to write in) and some Google Docs.</p>

<p>I think a lot goes on in a day, and days are far too long to store everything in your head. As a person with an <em>awful</em> memory, I found these little (occasionally schmedium) notes as a nice reminder of what actually happened. Sometimes a note in a mood tracker might suffice. Sometimes thoughts just need to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I won’t be spending much energy editing these entries. Damare, I apologize in advance. Everyone else, feel free to voice your concerns to the mid-night air – a surprisingly rare occurence.</p>

<p>xoxo</p>
